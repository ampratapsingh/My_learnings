// ðŸ”¹ What React.lazy does
// Normally, when you build your React app, the bundler (Webpack/Vite) puts all components into one big JS bundle.
// That means the browser downloads everything upfront, even if the user never visits some parts of the app.
// This can make the initial load slow.
// React.lazy allows you to dynamically import a component only when itâ€™s actually needed.
// ðŸ‘‰ This is called lazy loading.

// ðŸ”¹ How it works
// At first, the About component is not included in the main bundle.
// When React reaches <About />, it fetches that componentâ€™s code on demand (a separate bundle file).
// While itâ€™s loading, Suspense shows the fallback UI (like a loading spinner).
// Once loaded, React renders <About />

// ðŸ”¹ Real-world use case
// Imagine an Admin Dashboard that only some users access:
// Without React.lazy, all users download the dashboard code upfront (wasted for most).
// With React.lazy, the dashboard code is fetched only if the user goes to /admin.

// When you use React.lazy, you need to wrap the lazy-loaded components inside a <Suspense> component. Otherwise React wonâ€™t know what to render while those components are loading.
